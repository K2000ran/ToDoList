# 📝 To-Do List Application (Java OOP)

A simple **To-Do List Application** built using **Core Java** to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation**.  

This project was created as part of my **learning journey in Java**, after transitioning from C++.
